# TurtleBot3 SLAM Maze Navigation Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our TurtleBot3 SLAM Maze Navigation project. This repository is the central hub for all resources, documentation, and code for our innovative project. We aim to enable a TurtleBot3 equipped with LIDAR to autonomously navigate and solve mazes using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), fuzzy logic, and machine learning.
